# MLator Product




MLator is a project we worked together on to supply the Manga industry with an alternative to slow, low quality automated translation and expensive human translation.
It is an end to end product, with a backend which controls the logic of the application, a model which does the prediction for translation, and the front end which communicates between the user and the server.
