Instructions for environment setup and running script
=====================================================

Environment setup
-----------------
Assume our server already has standard Python 3.7.1 libraries and git installed. Then just run the 'deploy.py' script and its function 'create_or_update_environment()' will do the environment setup for us.

How to run script
-----------------
Open your terminal, navigate to the folder containing your script and run 'python deploy.py'. Then our product's server will be running on the remote ec2 instance.
